The broker is focusing on beginner traders and claims to be an
"Innovative platform for smart investments" with the promise of easy
profits, while "making online trading comfortable and safe".

But as we show you in this review, \*\*Quotex is not
innovative,\*\* \*\*it is not easy to make money on their platform and
it is definitely not safe.\*\* Let\'s see why.

## Quick Facts about Quotex

    LLC GROUP, a company based in St. Kitts and Nevis.

    \*\*including South Africa,\*\* Asia and South America, but it is
    not available in the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Russia and
    in most European countries.

## Is Quotex a Scam?

\*\*Yes, we believe that Quotex is a scam\*\* \*\*and you should not
open an account with them.\*\*

Their trading platform, trading tools and service agreement are designed
to make traders lose money in the long run. \*\*Quotex is not regulated
by any financial authorities\*\* \*\*so it is not a safe and legit
broker\*\* and nobody is protecting traders\' interest against shady,
unfair business practices.

\*\*Hint: we suggest you to trade on more trustworthy platforms
like\*\* \[\*\*Olymp
Trade\*\*\](https://eseta.org.za/go/olymptrade/quotex-cross/
"Olymptrade - Quotex cross") \*\*or\*\*
\[\*\*Exness\*\*\](https://eseta.org.za/exness/)\*\*.

## Let\'s take a closer look on some of our strong arguments why we think that Quotex is not a safe broker.

### 1. Not regulated at all

Quotex is based in St. Kitts and Nevis where there is no regulatory
framework for online trading brokers. This means that Quotex is not
licenced and overseen by any financial authorities and does not offer
any form of investor protection, such as compensation funds, negative
balance protections, and client fund segregation.

Quotex is included in the scam warning lists of several regulatory
authorities like the International Financial Commission, Reserve Bank of
India (RBI), the Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM) and the
Italian CONSOB.

### 2. It\'s easy to lose money while trading at Quotex

Quotex exclusively offers binary options trading (fixed time trading as
they call it), a high-risk high-reward trading type that makes trading
very exciting, but also very risky. It\'s very hard to be profitable at
binary options trading, even for experienced traders, because assets
price movements are almost unpredictable in such short timeframes.

Quotex does not offer other trading instruments, such as CFDs or
traditional stocks, where traders could open longer trades, choose
leverage levels, and set stop-loss and take-profit levels according to
their personal risk tolerance.

### 3. Misleading marketing tactics and trading tools

Quotex uses misleading marketing tactics and questionable trading
practices that make potential traders believe that they can make easy
and guaranteed money on their platform. Here are a few examples we found
of such unethical business practices:

#### Trading signals with 87% accuracy

Quotex advertises that it provides trading signals with an 87% accuracy
rate, which is very unrealistic, especially in fixed time trading. The
broker does not provide any explanation of how these signals are
generated or verified.

Quotex suggests that traders can make easy profits by following these
signals, but it\'s doubtful that these signals result from actual
advanced technical analysis and not just generated randomly.

\*\*When we tested the signals of Quotex, we had a 45% success rate,\*\*
which means that we lost money by following the signals.

#### Shady Deposit Bonus Terms

\[Quotex offers promo codes and deposit
bonuses\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/promo-code/) to new traders, but
hides important conditions from them. According to the Quotex service
agreement, "\_these bonuses\_ \*\*\_are subject to specific
terms\_\*\* \_and conditions" and "funds credited as bonuses\_
\*\*\_are not directly withdrawable.\_\*\* \_When a client performs
trading operations,\_ \*\*\_the funds they deposited are used
first,\_\*\* \_and only after these are exhausted can the bonus funds be
utilized for further operations."\_   Brokers often use such terms to
prevent withdrawals and lock traders\' funds in the platform.

#### Quotex "guaranteed winning" strategies

Quotex mainly became famous because of the hundreds of YouTube videos
discussing "secret trading tricks", "always winning
strategies", and "guaranteed profits", created by Quotex
affiliates. We understand that these claims are coming from Quotex
affiliates and not from the broker directly, but as we explained in our
\[Quotex affiliate program
overview\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/affiliate-program/) article, the
broker does not control or sanction misleading promises. We think that
a responsible trading platform should punish affiliates who use such
scammy promotional methods, just like \[Olymp
Trade\](https://eseta.org.za/go/olymptrade/quotex-cross/
"Olymptrade - Quotex cross") or \[IQ
Option\](https://eseta.org.za/iq-option/) are doing.

### 4. Bad reputation, many negative user reviews

Quotex receives many negative reviews about the difficulty in money
withdrawals, \[blocked trading
accounts\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/blocked-account/) for made-up
reasons and bad customer service from its users complaining on Reddit,
Trustpilot, and other credible review platforms.

Here are Quotex ratings across scam detection, investing-related review
platforms:

-   Trustpilot: 4.3/5 Trustscore with 505 reviews
-   Google Play Store: 3.2/5 with 26.9k reviews
-   Traders Union: 4.32/10 on regulation and safety

Here is an actual review from Sumit Kr Jha, a verified trader from
Trustpilot:

*Once you make a good profit they will come with a lots of tool to give
you the money\...like this document , that document. If you are really a
genuine broker all the verification should be done on first day.
Moreover you should apply rules but after the withdrawal for future
trades not for the finished trades and profit in the account.\_*

## Is Quotex legal?

\*\*Quotex\*\* \*\*is not legal in most countries like the USA, India,
Pakistan, Singapore, Philippines or the European Economic
Area,\*\* because the broker is not registered with the local regulatory
organizations.

Quotex is technically not illegal and not explicitly banned in South
Africa, but it\'s not regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct
Authority (FSCA), \*\*so your capital is not protected, if you are a
South African trader.\*\*

According to the FSCA, offshore brokers, like Quotex, don\'t need their
licence to accept South African traders as long as they are certified
and licensed in their respective home countries. But just because Quotex
is not illegal, we still think that \*\*it\'s a very risky platform that
should be avoided.\*\*

## Trading Platform Overview

The Quotex trading platform has the usual clean, very intuitive
interface optimized for beginner traders, just like the platform of
other typical binary option bokers\'. Below are some of the main
features of their trading platform
